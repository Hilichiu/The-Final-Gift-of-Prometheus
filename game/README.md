# Original Story

Prometheus: The Champion of Humankind

At a time when there were all-powerful gods in the universe, a Titan known as Prometheus created human beings out of clay. His brother Epimetheus then gave all living creatures on earth different qualities. Epimetheus gave animals speed, strength, fur, and wings. By the time he got to human beings, however, he had run out of gifts. To make up for their weaker state, Prometheus enabled them to stand upright like the gods. Not only kind but also generous, he gave them fire too so that they could keep warm, cook food, and make tools.

However, Prometheus’s love for humankind brought him into conflict with Zeus, the king of the Olympian gods. When the gods and humans met at Mecone to decide on the distribution of sacrifices that humans should make to the gods, Prometheus tricked Zeus for the benefit of humans. He slaughtered a bull and created two offerings. One was a pile of beef hidden inside a bull’s stomach, and the other was a pile of bones covered in shiny fat. He then asked Zeus to choose one. The king of the gods chose the second one, believing there must be juicy meat underneath the fat, but instead he ended up with nothing but bones. As a result, from that day on, humans would keep the meat for themselves and burn animal bones as an offering to the gods.

Angry about being tricked, Zeus took fire away from humankind. Without it, humans began to starve and freeze. Unable to make tools or weapons, they had to live in caves and often fell victim to wild beasts. Prometheus saw how miserable they were and decided to help. He took a stalk of fennel and fit its hollow center with fire that he had stolen from the sun. Then, he gave humans this stalk with the fire inside it.

Furious about Prometheus’s theft, Zeus punished the Titan by banishing him to a place far to the east.

There, Prometheus was chained to a rock, and an eagle sent by Zeus fed on Prometheus’s liver. Though his liver kept growing back, the eagle would return every day to gnaw at it again, torturing Prometheus until the end of time.

Through his sacrifice, Prometheus, who gave humans not only the ability to stand upright but also the gift of fire, which set the stage for human civilization, came to be known in later centuries as the “Champion of Humankind.”

# Plot Structure 
***(Continuation of the original story; Where we will perform the English drama show)***

## Day 1 Morning

Prometheus is tied to a stone on a high mountain -> Orcs discover that Prometheus's flesh is an "unlimited supply" -> A large group of orcs is gathered to rush over and "annihilate" the crows.

## Day 29 Morning

The "three-person team" passes nearby during their journey -> They feel the ground shaking constantly (caused by the orcs) -> They go in that direction and discover Prometheus's indescribable plight and suffering -> "The three-person team decides to help Prometheus."

## Day 29 Noon

After discussing, the humans decide that everyone should prepare and scout the enemy situation around the mountain:

> Knight: Practice
Magical Girl (FIRE): Fly into the air to watch
Magical Girl (HEALER): Jump to a higher mountain next to it

## Day 29 Night

The humans rescue Prometheus, but he has fallen into a coma.

## Day 30 Morning

The orcs discover that Prometheus is missing, so they go to hunt him down, and the three-person team decides to help Prometheus.

**A great battle is about to break out**

The magical girl throws a fireball at the orc's body with no effect -> The magical girl throws a fireball at the orc's feet.

A great battle with the orcs -> They are in a difficult battle -> Prometheus uses an "irreversible ability to wake up" to let the humans win.

Prometheus "dissipates" because of releasing this ability (when he is about to dissipate, the human trio tells him "very touching words")


# Full Story


### **The Final Gift of Prometheus**

**Characters:**

* **Prometheus:** The chained Titan.
* **Honoka Kisaragi:** A human with fire abilities.
* **Kaito Tachibana:** A human knight.
* **Yui Hoshizaki:** A human healer.
* **Orcade:** A massive Orc chieftain.
* **Narrator:** Provides context.

---

### **Scene 1: The Mountain of Torment**

**(Setting: A bleak mountaintop. PROMETHEUS is chained to a rock. An eagle is on him. ORCADE, a massive Orc, enters.)**

**Narrator:** Prometheus gave fire to man. For this, Zeus chained him to a mountain for endless torment. But on the first day, a new evil found him.

**(ORCADE growls, throws a rock at the eagle, which shrieks and flies away.)**

**Orcade:** (Sniffing the air) "Fresh meat. Endless. This mountain is ours. This feast... is *ours*!"

**(Orcade roars. He raises his STONE-CRUSHER AXE. Lights fade to black as Prometheus screams.)**

---

### **Scene 2: The Trembling Path**

**(Setting: A path below the peak. 29 days later. HONOKA, KAITO, and YUI are walking. The ground shakes.)**

**Honoka:** "Whoa! What's that shaking?"

**Kaito:** (Hand on his sword) "Not an earthquake. It's... footsteps. Heavy footsteps. From up there."

**Yui:** (Pointing, whispering) "L-look! Smoke! And... screaming. It sounds so p-painful."

**Honoka:** "I’ve got a bad feeling. Let's go!"

**(They creep to the edge of the stage and look "up" at the peak, horrified.)**

**Narrator:** The heroes climbed the peak. What they saw was a nightmare. The great Titan Prometheus was surrounded by orcs, led by Orcade, who feasted on him.

**Yui:** (Whispering) "They're... they're *eating* him... It's horrible."

**Kaito:** "That's Prometheus. The one who gave us fire."

**Honoka:** (Clenching her fists) "We *have* to save him. We can't fight them all in the day. We wait for night."

**Kaito:** "Agreed. Honoka, you create a distraction. Yui, you get to Prometheus. I'll cover you both. We strike fast, and we get him out."

---

### **Scene 3: The Night Rescue**

**(Setting: The peak, now dark. PROMETHEUS is chained. ORCADE is sleeping. Two orc guards are half-asleep.)**

**Narrator:** As darkness fell, the rescue began.

**Honoka:** (From off-stage, followed by a loud explosion sound) "HEY, UGLY! DINNER'S OVER!"

**(The two guards startle and run toward the noise. ORCADE wakes with a furious roar.)**

**Orcade:** "INTRUDERS! FIND THEM! KILL THEM!"

**(As Orcade storms off, KAITO and YUI rush from their hiding place to Prometheus.)**

**Kaito:** (Using his sword to break the chains) "Yui, now!"

**Yui:** (Rushes to the unconscious Prometheus, her hands glowing) "Lace Cloister Circle!" (A light-dome covers Prometheus). "He's so weak... he's in a coma."

**Kaito:** "We have to move!"

**(They lift Prometheus. ORCADE returns, his yellow eyes blazing.)**

**Orcade:** "THIEVES! You steal my FEAST!"

**Kaito:** (Shoving Prometheus toward Yui) "Go! I'll hold him!" (Kaito blocks a huge swing from Orcade's axe). "RUN!"

**(Yui and Honoka (who has run back) drag Prometheus off-stage. Kaito blocks one more blow and retreats.)**

---

### **Scene 4: The Final Stand**

**(Setting: A clearing at the base of the mountain. Morning. PROMETHEUS lies on the ground, still in a coma. YUI is trying to heal him. HONOKA and KAITO stand guard. ORCADE smashes through the trees.)**

**Orcade:** "NOWHERE TO RUN, LITTLE HUMANS. GIVE ME THE TITAN."

**Honoka:** "You'll have to go through us! Blazing Comet Fist!"

**(Honoka throws fire. It hits Orcade's chest and does nothing. He laughs.)**

**Orcade:** "Pathetic. Your fire is like a spark."

**Kaito:** "Honoka, his skin is too thick! But look at his legs! Those guards... they're made of **wood**!"

**Honoka:** (Her eyes light up) "Wood? Got it! Time to light a fire!"

**(She uses "Thermal Boost Glide" to dash low, shooting a stream of fire at Orcade's wooden leg guards.)**

**Orcade:** (Looks down, then roars in pain as the wood catches fire.) "WITCH! You'll pay!"

**(The leg guards burn away. He stumbles, now hurt and vulnerable. He goes into a "Berserker Rage," knocking Kaito and Honoka to the ground.)**

**Orcade:** (Limping but furious) "BREAK!" (He raises his axe to finish Honoka.)

**Yui:** "NO!"

**(Suddenly, a deep, powerful voice echoes. A warm, golden light fills the stage. PROMETHEUS is standing, his broken chains gone. He is glowing.)**

**Prometheus:** "...Enough."

**Honoka:** (Stunned) "Prometheus... You're awake!"

**Prometheus:** (He looks at the three humans, smiling) "For centuries, I suffered. But you came for me. You... with my fire in your heart." (Points to Honoka). "You... with the strength to protect others." (Nods to Kaito). "And you... with a kind heart to heal." (Looks at Yui).

**Yui:** (Crying) "But... you're... you're disappearing!"

**Prometheus:** "My torment is over. My body is broken. But my spirit has one last gift to give." (He turns to Orcade). "My soul... for your future."

**(Prometheus raises his hands. He releases a wave of pure light. The light washes over Orcade, who screams and dissolves into dust.)**

**Orcade:** "NO! IMPOSSIBLE...!"

**(The light fades. Prometheus sinks to his knees, fading.)**

**Kaito:** (Bowing his head) "We... we are honored."

**Honoka:** (Rushing to him, tears in her eyes) "Don't go! We promise to keep your fire safe!"

**Prometheus:** (Whispering) "You already are... Live well, children of my fire..."

**(Prometheus dissolves completely. The three heroes are left alone.)**

**Narrator:** And so, the torment of Prometheus ended. Not by a god, but by the courage, kindness, and fire of humanity. His spirit was, at last, free.

**(Honoka, Kaito, and Yui stand together, looking up. Lights fade.)**

**(End of Play)**

**Orcade：** 「沒地方跑了，小不點人類。把泰坦還給我。」

**Honoka：** 「你得先過我們這關！火炎彗星拳！」(Blazing Comet Fist!)

**(Honoka 擲出火焰。火焰打在 Orcade 的胸口上，毫無作用。他大笑起來。)**

**Orcade：** 「可悲。妳的火就像火花一樣。」

**Kaito：** 「Honoka，他的皮太厚了！但是看他的腿！那些護具……是**木頭**做的！」

**Honoka：** (眼睛一亮)「木頭？瞭解！該來點營火了！」

**(她使用「熱加速滑空」低空衝刺，將一道火流射向 Orcade 的木製護腿。)**

**Orcade：** (低下頭，隨後因木頭著火而痛苦地咆哮。)「女巫！妳會付出代價！」

**(護腿燒毀了。他踉蹌著，受了傷，暴露了弱點。他進入了「狂戰士之怒」(Berserker Rage)，將 Kaito 和 Honoka 擊倒在地。)**

**Orcade：** (一邊跛腳一邊暴怒)「碎裂吧！」(他舉起巨斧，準備了結 Honoka。)

**Yui：** 「不要！」

**(突然，一個低沉而有力的聲音響起。溫暖的金光充滿了整個舞台。普羅米修斯站了起來，斷裂的鎖鏈消失了。祂全身發光。)**

**普羅米修斯：** 「……夠了。」

**Honoka：** (震驚地)「普羅米修斯……你醒了！」

**普羅米修斯：** (祂看著三個人類，微笑著)「我受苦了幾世紀。但你們為我而來。妳……心中有著我的火焰。」(指向 Honoka)「你……擁有保護他人的力量。」(對 Kaito 點頭)「還有妳……有著治癒一切的善良的心。」(看著 Yui)

**Yui：** (哭著)「但是……你……你正在消失！」

**普羅米修斯：** 「我的折磨結束了。我的身體已經毀壞。但我的靈魂，還有最後一份禮物要給予。」(祂轉向 Orcade)「我的靈魂……換取你們的未來。」

**(普羅米修斯舉起雙手。他釋放出一股純粹的光芒。光芒席捲了 Orcade，Orcade 尖叫著化為了塵土。)**

**Orcade：** 「不！不可能……！」

**(光芒散去。普羅米修斯跪倒在地，身體逐漸變淡。)**

**Kaito：** (低下頭)「我們……我們深感榮幸。」

**Honoka：** (衝向祂，淚流滿面)「不要走！我們保證會守護你的火焰！」

**普羅米修斯：** (低語)「你們已經在這麼做了……好好活下去，我的火之子……」

**(普羅米修斯完全消散了。三位英雄獨自留在原地。)**

**旁白：** (Narrator) 就這樣，普羅米修斯的折磨結束了。不是藉由神，而是藉由人類的勇氣、善良與火焰。祂的靈魂，也終於獲得了自由。

**(Honoka、Kaito 和 Yui 站在一起，仰望著天空。燈光漸暗。)**

**(劇終)**
