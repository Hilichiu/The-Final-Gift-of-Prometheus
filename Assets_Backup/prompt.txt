* bgm_journey.mp3
    * Genre: Adventurous, Hopeful, Orchestral.
    * Generation Plan: Create a 1:30 loop. Use a wandering flute melody, light pizzicato strings, and a gentle, walking-pace percussion. It should feel like the start of an adventure. (Keywords: Adventure, Light, Hopeful, Journey, RPG).
* bgm_tension.mp3
    * Genre: Suspense, Cinematic.

* bgm_rescue.mp3
    * Genre: Stealth, Tense.
    * Generation Plan: Create a 1:30 loop. Use quiet pizzicato (plucked) strings for a "tip-toe" feeling. Add a xylophone for a light, sneaky melody and a very soft, high-hat rhythm. (Keywords: Stealth, Sneaking, Tense, Night, Heist).

    * Genre: Divine, Triumphant, Emotional.
    * Generation Plan: Create a 1:30 piece (not a loop, it should build). Start quiet with a harp arpeggio, then swell with a full orchestra and a powerful, wordless angelic choir.

* bgm_farewell.mp3
    * Genre: Sad, Reflective, Piano.
    * Generation Plan: Create a 2-minute loop. A simple, slow, melancholic piano melody. A soft string pad in the background for atmosphere. It should feel sad, but also peaceful. (Keywords: Sad, Farewell, Reflective, Piano, Ending).
